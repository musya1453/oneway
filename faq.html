            <div class="text">
              Chiropractic is Greek ‘to do by hand’. It is the science, art and philosophy of removing subluxations of
              the nervous system, thus helping the body remain in a state of homeostasis, or a state of equilibrium,
              that is self healing and self regulating. The brain and nervous system controls and regulates every cell,
              tissue organ, system and function of our body.
